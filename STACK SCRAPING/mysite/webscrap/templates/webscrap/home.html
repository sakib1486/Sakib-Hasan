<p> Hello. This is a very normalized site on scraping data related to "ANDROID" from <a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com">'StackOverflow'</a>,
    which is a Question-Answering site normally related to programming world. This is one of the most popular, if not the
    most popular site in the world for programming problems' knowledge sharing.</p>

<p> In this site, I can see the <a href="/voted/">10 MOST VOTED</a>  and  <a href="/newest/">10 NEWEST</a>  questions(Q or A) at any time
     with an [ANDROID] and so I might be able to stay relevant to the most specific questions at any time. There is also a new feature
    in this website which is yet to be implemented, and I am trying to find out a suitable new feature which might be interesting. So,
    at the left side you can find only three tabs to explore currently. We can get which tab does what from the names of teh tabs respectively.</p>

<p> <a href="/voted/">10 MOST VOTED QUESTIONS</a> : In this tab, anyone can find the 10 most voted questions on the tag [android] from this moment
    to last one week time. Upon clicking the question title this will pop-up another new tab and redirect to the main question
    thread on <a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a></p>
<p> <a href="/newest/">10 NEWEST QUESTIONS</a> : In this tab, anyone can find the 10 newest questions on the tag [android] from this moment
    to last one week time. Upon clicking the question title this will pop-up another new tab and redirect to the main question
    thread on <a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a></p>

<p> <a href="/latest/">10 LATEST QUESTIONS(NOT COMPLETED YET)</a> : This is my new feature. In this tab, I will sort out from the latest questions on StackOverflow
    , the last posted 10 Questions first. And among them, I will display which questions are with the tag of [android].
    If there isn't any, nothing will show up then. And, if there are some questions, anyone can go directly to the question
    thread. </p>

    site on the internet, any user of this site have to access this locally.</p>
